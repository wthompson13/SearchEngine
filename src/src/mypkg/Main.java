Check out my branch (william) to see a form I made for the main screen. I added a button to open a second form and added a close
button on that form. For some reason the button text changed when I added an actionListener.
I thought maybe one of you guys could create the second form for the index information and the other could handle stub methods.
That is, the methods that we don't have code for yet, like saving the index file and how to import/remove files being searched
