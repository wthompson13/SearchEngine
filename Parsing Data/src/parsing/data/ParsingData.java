 * I'm not sure on how to parse the data
 * I looked at the example on the class website, but I'm still confused as to 
 * the word thing for the txt files. Do we pick any words to search for in the
 * txt file??
 * 
 * David Blocher: Searching won't be implemented until the next part. What we
 * need right now is the ability to extract words from the text files to be
 * used for making the index that we'll later use to do the searching.
